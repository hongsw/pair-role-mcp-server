}
```

### 2️⃣ Usage in Claude

```
👤 User: "claude-agents-power를 이용해서 이 프로젝트를 위한 추천 및 agents/*.md 파일을 다운로드 해줘"

🤖 Claude: I'll analyze your project and download the recommended agents for you.

[Uses MCP tools to:]
1. 📊 Analyze your project structure 
2. 🎯 Recommend suitable roles
3. 📁 Download agents to ./claude/agents/
4. ✅ Ready to use sub-agents for your project!
```

### 3️⃣ Verify Installation

Check that agents were downloaded:
```bash
ls ./claude/agents/

```

### 4️⃣ Start Using Sub-Agents

Now you can use specialized roles in Claude:
```
"frontend-developer를 사용해서 React 컴포넌트를 만들어줘"
"data-scientist로 이 데이터를 분석해줘"  
"devops-engineer가 CI/CD 파이프라인을 설정해줘"
```
